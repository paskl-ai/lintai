## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Multi-file CLI support**: Both `scan` and `ai-inventory` commands now accept multiple files and directories as arguments
- **Cross-file analysis**: Enhanced analysis engine tracks function calls and AI usage patterns across file boundaries
- **Enhanced LLM detector context**: LLM-powered detectors now receive caller/callee context from other files for improved security analysis
- **Call-flow context in prompts**: LLM audit prompts include snippets from calling functions across files
- **Improved graph export**: Call graph visualization includes complete function→function→AI component chains
- **Mixed argument support**: CLI commands support mixing individual files and directories in the same command

### Enhanced

- Analysis engine with integrated AI call tracking and cross-file relationship mapping
- Error handling for external library calls in context collection
- CLI argument parsing to handle multiple paths gracefully
- Budget management and token tracking across multi-file analysis

### Usage Examples

- `lintai scan file1.py file2.py directory/`
