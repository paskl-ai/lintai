## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-20

### üöÄ Major Release - Complete Terminology Overhaul & Feature Enhancements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- **CLI Commands Renamed**:
  - `lintai scan` ‚Üí `lintai find-issues`
  - `lintai ai-inventory` ‚Üí `lintai catalog-ai`
- **API Endpoints Renamed**:
  - `/api/scan` ‚Üí `/api/find-issues`
  - `/api/inventory` ‚Üí `/api/catalog-ai`
  - `/api/inventory/{rid}/subgraph` ‚Üí `/api/catalog/{rid}/subgraph`

### Added

- **New Security Detectors**:
  - `LLM02`: Secret-in-prompt detector for hardcoded API keys and sensitive data
  - `LLM06`: Excessive agency detector for overprivileged AI components
- **Complete Frontend Overhaul**:
  - Modern React-based UI with pagination and improved navigation
  - Dedicated "Security Findings" and "AI Catalog" pages with clear separation
  - Real-time job tracking with WebSocket-like updates
  - Enhanced dashboard with meaningful statistics and history
  - Comprehensive settings page with API key management
- **Multi-file CLI support**: Both `find-issues` and `catalog-ai` commands now accept multiple files and directories as arguments
- **Cross-file analysis**: Enhanced analysis engine tracks function calls and AI usage patterns across file boundaries
- **Enhanced LLM detector context**: LLM-powered detectors now receive caller/callee context from other files for improved security analysis
- **Call-flow context in prompts**: LLM audit prompts include snippets from calling functions across files
- **Improved graph export**: Call graph visualization includes complete function‚Üífunction‚ÜíAI component chains
- **Mixed argument support**: CLI commands support mixing individual files and directories in the same command
- **Pagination support**: Frontend and API endpoints now support proper pagination for large datasets
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated frontend build and deployment workflow

### Enhanced

- **Terminology Consistency**: Clear distinction between "Security Findings" (vulnerabilities) and "AI Catalog" (component inventory)
- **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation, consistent labeling, and improved error handling
- **Analysis engine**: Integrated AI call tracking and cross-file relationship mapping
- **Error handling**: Better handling for external library calls and edge cases
- **CLI argument parsing**: Robust handling of multiple paths and mixed arguments
- **Budget management**: Token tracking and cost estimation across multi-file analysis

### Usage Examples

**New Command Syntax:**
```bash
# Security vulnerability analysis
lintai find-issues file1.py file2.py directory/
lintai find-issues examples/main.py examples/chatbot.py -l DEBUG

# AI component cataloging
lintai catalog-ai examples/ --graph
lintai catalog-ai src/ --output ai-inventory.json
```

### Fixed

- Dashboard expansion behavior for security findings
- Frontend routing between findings and catalog pages
- Job type consistency across backend and frontend
- Error handling for empty Python file lists in catalog operations
- Build and deployment issues in CI/CD pipeline
